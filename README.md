## Backend 

In order to run the backend you'll need NPM and MongoDB. <br>
To run the server just run the comand: `node server`

In order to connect to your database you need to create a `.env` file and fill it out like the `.env.example` file. <br>
Just change the `<username>` and `<password>` with yours respectivly. <br>
If you wish to use a different port you will need to change the fetch calls in the frontend. 

## Frontend

Just run it with any live server
